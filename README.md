-   View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

-   View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

> **Important:** Look into using a MongoDB aggregate function to dynamically add up and return the total duration for each workout. Check out the [MongoDB documentation on the $addFields](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/), the [MongoDB documentation on the $sum operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/), and the [Mongoose documentation on aggregate functions](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#aggregate_Aggregate) to learn how it can be accomplished.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

-   [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

-   [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)
